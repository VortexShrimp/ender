# ender/examples
Various projects using *ender* to showcase its capabilities.

## crypto_price_checker
This example demonstrates how to use `ender::lua_window`
to create an application with an ImGUI user interface that
is scripted with Lua.

The application makes asynchronous GET requests to a crypto REST API
and parses the JSON response to display the current price of a
cryptocurrency.

## menu_app
